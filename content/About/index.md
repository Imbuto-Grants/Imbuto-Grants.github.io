## Vision
To create a thriving network of young innovators and changemakers who are equipped with the resources, mentorship, and connections necessary to bring their ideas to life. By focusing on young people, we aim to nurture the next generation of leaders and problem-solvers who can drive sustainable change. We believe that raising the ambitions of young individuals is one of the highest impact and lowest cost interventions possible.

## Mission
Our mission is to identify and support high-potential individuals who have the potential to make a significant impact in their communities and beyond. We believe in the power of small, unconditional grants to unlock creativity and drive positive change.

## Objectives
- **Provide Financial Support**: Offer quarterly grants ranging from $50 to $500 to individuals and small groups with innovative ideas or projects.
- **Community Building**: Foster a supportive community where grantees can interact, share ideas, and collaborate on initiatives.
- **Ambition Raising**: Empower grantees to believe in themselves and pursue their goals with greater confidence, encouraging them to achieve great things.
- **Mentorship and Networking**: Where possible, connect grantees with mentors and provide access to the founders' networks to help them grow and succeed.
