To be eligible for a micro-grant you have to be a Rwandan under the age of 30. 

There is no specific mold for what a typical grant will fund however we will focus on ideas that have the following traits:
- Scalable
- High impact 
- Funding constrained 

Grants will be awarded to cohorts of grantees every quarter with the first grants scheduled to be awarded in mid-September 2024. 

Cohorts will be invited to meet each other at time of awarding, and we will aim to host an annual summit/conference for all grantees to meet and share updates of their progress.
