      <description>To be eligible for a micro-grant you have to be a Rwandan under the age of 30.
There is no specific mold for what a typical grant will fund however we will focus on ideas that have the following traits:
Scalable High impact Funding constrained Grants will be awarded to cohorts of grantees every quarter with the first grants scheduled to be awarded in mid-September 2024.
Cohorts will be invited to meet each other at time of awarding, and we will aim to host an annual summit/conference for all grantees to meet and share updates of their progress.</description>
