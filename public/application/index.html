<h1></h1>

<p>To be eligible for a micro-grant you have to be a Rwandan under the age of 30.</p>
<p>There is no specific mold for what a typical grant will fund however we will focus on ideas that have the following traits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scalable</li>
<li>High impact</li>
<li>Funding constrained</li>
</ul>
<p>Grants will be awarded to cohorts of grantees every quarter with the first grants scheduled to be awarded in mid-September 2024.</p>
<p>Cohorts will be invited to meet each other at time of awarding, and we will aim to host an annual summit/conference for all grantees to meet and share updates of their progress.</p>
